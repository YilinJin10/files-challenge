		<h1>Olaf</h1>
		<img src="img/Olaf.png">
		<p>Olaf is a snowman character from the 2013 animated film Frozen, produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios.</p>
		<br />
		<p>His first appearance in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_(2013_film)">Frozen</a> is during Anna and Elsa's childhood as an inanimate snowman. Later, Olaf is recreated during the first verse of "Let It Go", and unknown to Elsa, comes to life. A few days later, Anna and Kristoff cross paths with Olaf while traveling through a meadow. Anna's first instinct is to give Olaf the carrot nose that he had been missing. Before they continue on their way, Olaf sings a shot number fantasizing about what it might be like to experience summer heat, and blissfully unaware that he'll melt. Olaf then guides Anna and Kristoff to Elsa's ice palace.</p>
